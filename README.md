Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

This repository contains all of my assignment solutions and outputs for the Deep Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai taught by the instructor Andrew Ng. 



Do not copy the solutions from this repository: It is intended to be a reference. It's main purpose is as a reference for myself to look back upon when working on further projects related to these topics. 

This specialization had five courses:

Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects (no assignments, just case studies)

Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

Course 5: Sequence Models
